- 👋 Hi, I’m @abstractpraxis
- 👀 I'm building a digital hub for artists who want to integrate their spirituality with their creative practice and making tools to assist with this as well.
- 🌱 I’m a Global Studies major & I will be learning Python asaptually.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that flow with the theme of creativity & spiritual enrichment, even if somewhat abstractly.
